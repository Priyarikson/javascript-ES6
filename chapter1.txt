JavaScript=>JS,programming language designed to allow the progranmmer to build interactive web applications.
ECMAScript is a scripting language specification standardized by ECMA International.It was created to standardize JavaScript in an attemt to allow for independent and compatible implementations.ECMAScript6 or ES6

scope
scope is the region of a computer program where a variable or function is valid.

function scope=> when a function is declared a new scope block is created inside the body of that function.
variables defined with var
block scope

parent scope=>global scope
parent scope is the block of the section of code that the  function was defined in .
function scope hoisting
instantiation??? i dont understand
instance - an example or single occurrence of something.
instantiation meaning - represent as or by an instance.
hoist - raise
hoisting means that the interpreter moves the instantiation of an entity to the top of the scope it was declared in regardless of where in the scope block it is defined....

<script>
        example = 5;
        console.log(example);output is 5 
        var example; //its only declaring here but got output brfore..
</script>
block scope{}
a pair of curly braces can be placed anywhere in the code to define a new scope block .{}
variables defined with let and const
if statements,loops,functions and any other curly brace pairs will have their own block space  .
this includes floating curly brace pairs not associated with a keyword.(if,for,etc)

variables declared with the keywords let and const have block scope.no variable hoisting 
temporal dead zone......accessing a variable declared with let before the assignment will throw a runtime error.

declaring variables

immutable - fixed
<script>
       //declared and initialized 
       const example = {prop1:'test'}
       //variable reassigned
       example = 5; //can not do this //index.html:14 Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
    //at index.html:14:16
       console.log(example)
       //object property updated
       example.prop1 = 5; // this is okay works bcoz subproperty was modified
       console.log(example)
    </script>
       try...catch
       The code in the try block is executed first, and if it throws an exception, the code in the catch block will be executed. 
       
       A catch-block contains statements that specify what to do if an exception is thrown in the try-block. If any statement within the try-block (or in a function called from within the try-block) throws an exception, control is immediately shifted to the catch-block. If no exception is thrown in the try-block, the catch-block is skipped.
<script>
       
       console.log('hoisted before assignment:',hoisted);
       var hoisted = 'this got hoisted';
       console.log('hoisted after assignment:',hoisted);
       try{
        console.log(notHoisted1);
       }catch(err){
        console.log('notHoisted1 with error:',err.message);
       }
       let notHoisted1 = 5;
       console.log('notHoisted1 after assignment:',notHoisted1);
       try{
        console.log(notHoisted2);
       }catch(err){
        console.log('notHoisted2 with error:',err.message);
       }
       const notHoisted2 = [1,2,3];
       try{
        notHoisted2 = 'new value';
       }catch(err){//error parameter
        console.log('notHoisted2 was not able to be changed');
       }
       notHoisted2.push(5);//The push() method appends values to an array.//return The new length property of the object upon which the method was called.
        
        console.log('notHoisted2 updated. Now is:',notHoisted2);

    </script>
    const notHoisted2 =>kerword variable
    const notHoisted2 = [1,2,3]; //assigning value

const
the array content or object properties can be changed.the contents of an array can be modified with functions push(),pop(),map()and object properties can be added, removed or updated

The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that value to the caller. If you call pop() on an empty array, it returns undefined.

Arrow functions or Fat arrow functions =>
anonymous.
frquently used in callback chains,promise chains, array methods..in any situation  
not named and not bound to an identifier.an arrow function is created dynamically and is not given a name like normal functions, can be assigned to a variable for reuse.
not assigned a 'this' scope...
//arrow function
        const fn1 = function(a, b) {return a+b ;};
        const fn2 = (a, b)=> {return a+b ;};
       console.log(fn1(3,5),fn2(3,5));

       //single argument arrow function
        arg1 => {/*code here*/}
        //non simple identifier function argument
        (arg1 = 10) => {/*code here*/}
        //no arguments passed into the function
        () => {/*code here*/}
        //multiple line body arrow function
        (arg1, arg2) => {
            console.log(`this is arg1: ${arg1}`);
            console.log(`this is arg2: ${arg2}`);
            console.log(`this is arg3: ${arg3}`);
            /*code more here*/
        }
        //single line body arrow function
        (arg1, arg2) => console.log(`this is arg1: ${arg1}`);
        // with and without return keyword
        ( num1, num2 ) => { return (num1+num2); };
        ( num1, num2 ) => num1+num2;
        
        // arrow function with a singleline body // see no parenthesis in the front no wrapping
        ( numArray ) => numArray.filter( n => n>5 ).map( n => n-1 ).every( n=>n<10 );  
        //  arrow function with a singleline body broken into multiple lines
        ( numArray ) => (
            numArray.filter( n => n>5 )
            .map( n => n-1 )
            .every( n=>n<10 )
            );
            // arrow function with an object literal in the body // returns an object
            (num1, num2) => ({prop1:num1,prop2:num2});
this 
arrow functions are not assigned a this scope. they inherit their parents this scope and can not have a new this scope bound to them.the scope of this can not be changed in an arrow function. 

Template Literals - new form of string
(``)
`${expression}`
template literals allow you to embed expressions in the string that are evaluated at runtime.
 to escape a template literal simply use a backslash(\)character 
 `\'` === "'"
 
 //tagged template literals
        //tag functions
Tags allow you to parse template literals with a function.
The first argument of a tag function contains an array containing string values.the string values represent the parts of the input string broken at each template expression.
the remaining arguments are the values of the template expressions in the string ...
raw
The special raw property, available on the first argument to the tag function, allows you to access the raw strings as they were entered, without processing escape sequences.

syntactic sugar
is a syntax that is designed to make expressions easier to read and express.it makes the syntax "sweeter" because code can be expressed concisely.


Classes and Modules
prototype
When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its prototype. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with null as its prototype.
Every object with its methods and properties contains an internal and hidden property known as [[Prototype]]. The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. 

instantiation 
An instantiation pattern in JavaScript is a way to create an object using functions. There are five instantiation patterns: Functional, Functional-shared, Prototypical, Pseudoclassical, and ES6.
